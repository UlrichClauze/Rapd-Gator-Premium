# Rapidgator-Premium

*Rapidgator provides its own file manager so that users can efficiently manage their files. The user can create his own folders to keep track of large amounts of data. Each file is displayed with the name, date of upload and actual file size. Rapidgator also provides a search function if a file cannot be found directly*

With a Rapidgator account the user has two options to share files. The best option for small files is to use the file manager in the web browser, which displays the estimated remaining time and the amount of data already uploaded in percent. If several files and larger amounts of data are to be uploaded, the upload via the FTP server should be used, which allows higher upload speeds

As soon as the files are uploaded to Rapidgator, the user will receive a link to share them with any number of others
